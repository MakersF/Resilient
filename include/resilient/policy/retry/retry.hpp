/**
 * @ingroup Policy
 * @brief Reduce the impact of tasks failing due to transient failures.
 *
 * A task might fail because of a temporary condition.
 * In such a situation the failure can be managed by retrying the operation again.
 *
 * The `Retry` calls the tasks which is executed with it until it succeeds or it's
 * determined that it shouldn't be executed anymore.
 * Optionally the `Retry` can wait between calls. This can be useful if the task is consuming
 * resources and there is no reason to try several executions as close as possible.
 *
 * For each execution of a task an associated `RetryState` is used.
 * Any class which abides to the `RetryState` concept can be used.
 * `Retry` is instantiate with a factory class which is called to get an instance of `RetryState`
 * for each task.
 * Any class which abides to the `RetryStateFactory` concept can be used.
 *
 * @par `RetryState` concept
 * A `RetryState` keeps track of the retries and failures of a task in a `Retry` and decides
 * whether it should be re-executed or not.
 * The following must be valid for an instance named `state` of type `T` which implements
 * the `RetryState` concept.
 *
 * @par
 * - Checking if `Retry` should retry.
 * The statement `resilient::Variant<resilient::retry_after, T::stopretries_type> a = state.shouldRetry();` must
 * be valid.
 * When `Retry` should execute again `holds_alternative<resilient::retry_after>(a)` must be true.
 * The current thread will wait for the duration of the value contained in `retry_after` if it's strictly positive.
 * When `Retry` should stop executing the task `holds_alternative<T::stopretries_type>(a)` must be true.
 * `Retry` will return a Failable with the failure set to the value of type `T::stop_retries`.
 *
 * @par
 * - Propagating failure informations.
 * Given an instance `failure` of type `Q`, the statement `state.failedWith(std::move(q));` must be valid.
 * `Q` is the `Failure` hold by the `Failable` the associated task returns.
 *
 *
 * @par `RetryStateFactory` concept
 * A `RetryStateFactory` is used to create a `RetryState` to associate to the execution of a task with the
 * `Retry` policy.
 * The following must be true for an instance named `factory` of type `T` which implements the
 * `RetryStateFactory` concept.
 *
 * @par
 * - Getting a `RetryState` instance
 * The statement `decltype(auto) state{factory.getRetryState(retriedtask_failure<Q>{})};` must be valid.
 * `Q` is the `Failure` hold by the `Failable` the associated task returns.
 * `state` must be an instance of a type which implements the `RetryState` concept.
 *
 * @par
 * - Returning a `RetryState` instance
 * The statement `factory.returnRetryState(std::forward<decltype(state)>(state));` must be valid.
 * The method is always called once for each call made to `getRetryState` which did not throw an exception,
 * independently from the result of the execution of the task.
 * This call is done after all the retries for the given task have been executed.
 *
 *
 * @tparam RetryStateFactory The factory used to create the RetryState used while
